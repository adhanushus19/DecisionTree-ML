The decision_tree_randomforest.py script is a comprehensive Python-based implementation aimed at predicting employee attrition using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms. Designed in Google Colab, it combines theoretical understanding with real-world application on an HR dataset (HR-Employee-Attrition.csv). The script starts with a detailed explanation of decision tree fundamentals, covering regression and classification trees, Gini impurity, entropy, and information gain. It compares ID3, C4.5, and CART algorithms, explaining how nodes are split using different criteria.

The data exploration phase includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses using Seaborn and Sweetviz to uncover relationships between features and employee attrition. Key variables like business travel, department, gender, and job role are visualized to draw meaningful insights. It then proceeds to data preprocessing with encoding of categorical features, removal of constant columns, and balancing the dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance.

The Decision Tree Classifier is implemented with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, followed by model training and evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and classification reports. Subsequently, a Random Forest Classifier is built, including extensive hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. The model is evaluated on test data for performance validation.

Overall, the script demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipelineâ€”from EDA and data cleaning to model training and optimization. It serves as both an educational resource and a practical tool for applying tree-based ensemble methods in HR analytics, making it ideal for learners and practitioners aiming to understand classification techniques for business problems.
